Planning to move to Europe or want to transport personal belongings abroad? This is a responsible process that requires knowledge of customs legislation, proper packaging of items, and document preparation. To avoid delays, fines, or even confiscation of property, it's important to follow official rules for transporting belongings to EU countries.

## What can be transported to Europe?

Personal belongings that are allowed to be transported include:

- Clothing, footwear, accessories
- Household and digital devices (TVs, laptops, phones)
- Furniture, dishes, household items
- Children's items, toys
- Bicycles, sports equipment

### Prohibited or restricted:

- Weapons and ammunition
- Alcohol and tobacco above the norm
- Food products, especially meat, dairy products, fruits and vegetables
- Medicines without prescriptions
- Animals and plants without special permits

## Customs rules: documents and nuances

When transporting belongings to Europe, it's important to declare them properly. In most countries, the principle applies that personal belongings are not subject to customs taxation if:

- You are changing your place of residence (for example, moving for permanent residence or work)
- Items have been in your use for at least 6 months
- You can confirm residence abroad (visa, residence permit, invitation, etc.)

## How to properly prepare belongings for transport?

- Create an inventory list with a description of each item
- If necessary, make copies of receipts or warranty cards for equipment
- Pack items in boxes, labeling each one — this will speed up inspection
- Photo documentation of items before packing — additional protection in case of damage
